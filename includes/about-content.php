     Scholastica's mission is to develop curious, knowledgeable and caring young individuals, who will be equipped to tackle head-on the challenges of our modern-day "global village." They will aspire to become responsible and productive citizens, who will contribute to their communities, and embrace and respect people from other cultures and walks of life. </p>
      <p>Scholastica was established in 1977 by Mrs. Yasmeen Murshed. It was founded to provide a balanced and well-rounded education for students, using English as the primary medium of instruction but placing equal emphasis on Bangla. </p>
      <p>The customized curriculum builds the knowledge, skills and attitudes that students need to succeed in their academic and professional careers after school. Students are encouraged to challenge themselves, their peers and their teachers in a setting that gives them confidence and builds their skills to think independently. </p>
